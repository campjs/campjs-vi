    <h1>CampJS Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
    orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual
    images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
    harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
    events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply
    immediately.</p>

    <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
    sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
    Sponsor attendees should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
    otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may
    take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
    expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You will not be welcome at any future events.</li>
      <li>You will not be entitled to a refund.</li>
      <li>Your behaviour may be communicated to other event organisers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have been very proud of the CampJS community for being mostly mature and
    well-behaved at our events thus far, and hopefully we will never have to enact
    any disciplinary measures. It is the purpose of this code of conduct to ensure
    everyone knows that we do not tolerate harassment or otherwise offensive
    behaviour and we want to know immediately if it's happening at one of our
    events.
    </p>
