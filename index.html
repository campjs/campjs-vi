      <h4>CampJS is for everyone who is interested in web technology. Beginners &amp; experts, all are welcome.</h4>
      <p>
        Networking with other developers is arguably the most valuable aspect of
        a conference, yet it’s often a hurried and fleeting affair that happens
        in-between the schedule of a regular conference — but CampJS isn’t a
        regular conference. This weekend-long retreat allows everyone enough
        time to learn new things, relax and most importantly: create real
        friendships and connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        CampJS creates a unique blend of expert-led, structured content
        and self-directed, unstructured learning. Some content is
        scheduled, but the main area is reserved for hacking. The final
        night is reserved for demos for people to show off what they have
        built or learned at the event.
      </p>
      <h3>When?</h3>
      <p>
        CampJS V will commence at 3pm Friday on the 22nd of May, and
        run through to 9am Monday the 25th of May. The Camp will be held at <a
        href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Lord+Somers+Camp+Parklands+Avenue+Somers&sll=-37.787844,145.025454&sspn=0.019637,0.046778&ie=UTF8&cid=-38391441,145152110,7610982389541332772&ll=-38.382642,145.160122&spn=0.023548,0.036478&z=14&iwloc=A&source=embed">Lord

      We’re going to dive into the mysteries of hardware programming with
      JavaScript. You’ll get all the parts and tools necessary to build your
      own kick-ass boat with a Spark Core at its connected heart.
      </p>
      <p>
      We’ll throw you in a team of two and your
      creativity and craftsmanship is key to come up with, build and program the best
      boat of the conference. This workshop will be delivered in multiple parts
      over the weekend and on the Sunday afternoon you’ll get to test your boat
      in a race against other competitors, with prizes for the winning team.
      </p>
      <p>We only have limited spots for this event, <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/yxQD3tbv5N">please register your interest here</a> if you plan on participating.</p>

        At the core of WebGL is GLSL, a domain-specific language that allows you
        to write code leveraging the power of your graphics card for super speedy
        rendering of countless triangles and/or pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/stackgl/glslify">glslify</a> adds a Node.js-like module system on top of the language, so you
        can create and consume community packages on npm with GLSL as easily
        as you can with JavaScript. <strong>This is an introduction to how glslify works, why you’d
        want to use it, and what’s possible using the tool.</strong>

      <p>
        This workshop covers the past, present and future of web application
        performance when it comes to delivery optimization. We’ll start by glancing
        over what you’re already doing — minifying your static assets, bundling them
        together, and using progressive enhancement techniques. Then we’ll move on to
        what you should be doing — optimizing TCP network delivery, inlining critical
        CSS, deferring font loading and CSS so that you don’t block the rendering path,
        and of course deferring JavaScript. Afterwards we’ll look at the future, and
        what HTTP 2.0 has in store for us, going full circle and letting us forego
        hacks of the past like bundling and minification.

      <p>
        Join Kim Carter in the exploration into an insightful set of steps he has learned, from an architectural perspective down to the zeros and ones. Also providing insights of how attackers of your systems think.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will also look at other tried and tested practices and processes for reducing security defects early. That is every Sprint for each Product Backlog Item (PBI). As an architect, engineer and security specialist, Kim will uncover how to identify the lowest hanging fruit (for the attackers) by taking a <a href="https://github.com/binarymist/HolisticInfoSec-For-WebDevelopers/">holistic approach</a> (a 30,000′ view), then honing in on the areas with the highest security ratings, based on a tried and tested threat modelling process that allows you to discover and prioritise the defects most likely to be compromised by attackers of your systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are going to look at automating (Security Test (Behaviour) Driven Development (STDD/SBDD)) some of the traditional manual based penetration testing methods often performed after go live and bringing them forward into parallel with your development cycles (Sprints).<br>
        Thus empowering Developers to do what was once only performed by deeply specialised security consultancies at the end of the project. Dramatically increasing the confidence we as developers have in what we are delivering, thus reducing the cost of change due to defects being found as they are introduced rather than at go live.

      <p>
        Scope Chains, Closures, Hoisting, and Garbage Collection all have one thing in common: They’re often hand-waved away. How do closures actually work? When does Garbage Collection occur? What really IS the Scope Chain?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this talk, we will discover it’s not black magic after all; No hand waving is required to explain these language features, in fact you’ve been using them all along without realising.

      <h3><a href="#ryan-pauley">Ryan Pauley</a></h3>
      <p>
        CORS enables web applications to share information from server to server.
        Without CORS, APIs, and much of the internet are far more frustrating to
        share with. Introduced to CORS in a Rails&lt;&gt;Node project, I had a
        head-smashing time trying to get our servers to play nice and share data.
        I wasn’t content with stack overflow’s cut &amp; paste fix and this
        presentation is the end result of my desire to come to a better idea of
        how to manage CORS challenges.

        <em>Your web apps are at risk!</em> Security is crucial but can be hard to get right.
        Luckily for web developers, the HTTP protocol comes with well-thought-out
        security specifications. Modern browsers implementing those security features
        are capable of doing much of the heavy lifting for us. It is our responsibility
        to put the browsers on guard. This talk explores which security headers are
        especially useful along with when and how to use them.

        ORTC is a free open-source project that enables mobile and server

        simple JavaScript APIs. It builds upon the existing WebRTC capabilities
        of the browser and fills in some gaps to make interoperating with mobile
        devices and servers possible. This talk will answer some questions about
        what is missing in WebRTC, what does ORTC hope to achieve and why do you
        care. It will also dive into some open source ORTC implementations and
        give a demo.

        Tracking data changes and presenting them to the user is a fundamental

        us a fast, native way to track changes to standard objects without the
        need for custom model types or dirty state checking. As game-changing
        as this new functionality may be, we might just be seeing the beginning
        of the next great JavaScript rivalry: mutable versus immutable state.

        An introduction to advanced payment techniques with bitcoin using JavaScript.
        A talk will cover a basic primer on bitcoin and the reasons for some of
        the difficulties in this area; including limitations. A follow-up workshop will involve some basic tutorials as well as advanced.

        I’m going to briefly cover the various modules that make up
        <a href="https://github.com/Raynos/mercury">mercury</a>,
        which will touch on virtual DOM, delegated events and
        observable state. I’ll also show a few examples which will hopefully
        illustrate why these concepts work so well together, and why not
        prescribing specific implementation details is a good thing.

      <p>
        Unlike others, for good or bad, the Javascript community is a headless
        monster. It is exactly the decentralised nature of the JS community
        which has allowed us to thrive far beyond other comparable
        technologies.
      </p>
      </p>
        So when it comes to steering the moral behaviour of the Javascript
        swarm, it takes a hive-mind rather than a top-down approach. So we need
        to be communicating about this on a regular basis.
      </p>
      </p>
        It is everyone’s responsibility to make the Javascript community one
        which welcomes people from all backgrounds, and that unless we take
        this seriously and ALL contribute to what defines to collectively
        acceptable behaviour, then (even from a purely selfish POV) we rapidly
        diminish the quality of our environment (And of course do real harm to
        others).

        At Thinkmill, React has changed our client-side development experience. We’re
        building more complex things with less code, and having more fun doing it. So
        I want to share that with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this session we’ll go through an intro to React, what it brings to the table,
        and how it fits into a modern development workflow. We’ll also see how you can
        start using it without a painful transition process, take advantage of reusable
        components, and look at how that scales to a complex React.js application.

      <h2><a name="offline-first" href="#offline-first">Offline-first Hackathon with DigitalOcean</a></h2>
      <h3><a href="#angelina-fabbro">Angelina Fabbro</a></h3>
      <h4>Theme</h4>
      <p>
        Why ditch your phone when you go bush? There’s no internet connection
        but a few well made applications can make or break those boring moments trapped
        in a rainy tent when the weather gets bad. Help us innovate our way around a
        lack of network connectivity in this offline-sync themed hackathon.
        There will be prizes for the best entries.
      </p>

      <h4>Teams</h4>
      <p>We recommend that you form teams of 2-3 people. Building an app from scratch in a few days is a lot of work. That being said, you can work on your own or in a larger size team: it’s up to you.</p>

      <p>In designing the prize packs, we tried to provide enough cool stuff for roughly a team of three.</p>

      <h4>Criteria</h4>
      <p>All submissions must:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>…function nearly identical in both online/offline states, which is to say in the best case the user doesn’t ever notice a difference between the two</li>
        <li>…sync data to a DigitalOcean droplet/virtual server</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Beyond these two criteria, you can be as creative as your heart desires. You’re encouraged to stay on theme with “camping” because arbitrary constraints as such can make magic happen. However, really we just want you to make something super cool and have a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>To get started quickly, you might be interested in <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/features/one-click-apps/mean/">DigitalOcean’s MEAN stack one-click deploy</a>.
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Turn-based multiplayer game that syncs game state to the server, chat app that syncs communication, mapping app that updates the location of other campers in relation to one another when connectivity is available</p>
      <h4>On-Theme Hacking Prompts</h4>
      <p>Here’s a few “hacking prompts” in the style of essay or writing prompts. These ideas are here for you to bounce off of on your way toward your great idea:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disaster has stuck and its up to you to save the day</li>
        <li>Everyone is stuck in their tents during bad weather: how can we all communicate?</li>
        <li>Map your own adventure</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Judging</h4>
      <p>Before <strong>5pm on Sunday</strong>, email <a href="cyborg@digitalocean.com">cyborg@digitalocean.com</a> with the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The name of your app</li>
        <li>What is the app supposed to do? (eg. “It’s a game”, “camping navigation helper”)</li>
        <li>Some screenshots of your app’s UI, any wireframes that went into designing the app</li>
        <li>Explain to us what information the app stores offline, and how and when it syncs to the remote server</li>
        <li>Describe a bit about what technologies you chose for the project and why (e.g. “I chose Angular because I wub it”)</li>
        <li>Tell us about any challenges you encountered</li>
        <li>Tell us what else you would have built given more time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You don’t need to write a novel here: make sure you app speaks for itself.</p>
      <p>Angelina will follow-up and tell you when you will be able to demo your app to the judges during the window of 3-4:30pm. You will have a five minute demo slot to show the judges your app in action. <strong>HARD STOP</strong> at five minutes.</p>
      <p> Winners will be announced late in the evening after demos</p>
      <p>Projects will be judged by the CampJS mentors according to the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Online vs. Offline experience: Does the app continue to provide value to the user when offline as compared to online? Does the experience degrade gracefully for the user when connectivity is interrupted?</li>
        <li>Stability: Does the app crash on us? Crashy hackathon apps usually mean you didn’t scope your features well, so be careful.</li>
        <li>Usability: Is the app easy for us to use without you having to explain “press that button over there”?</li>
        <li>Surprise &amp; Delight: Does the app make us feel like sparkles</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="nodeschool" href="#nodeschool">International NodeSchool Day</a></h2>
      <p>
      Inspired by Substack’s <a href="https://github.com/substack/stream-adventure">stream-adventure</a>,
      Rod Vagg unveiled <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode">learnyounode</a>
      and the <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper">workshopper framework</a> at CampJS II in August 2013.
      This began a chain reaction resulting in the formation of <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">NodeSchool</a>,
      an amazing global community spreading JavaScript skills worldwide.
      NodeSchool has grown to 26 workshops and inspired many hundreds
      of community events worldwide. You can read more about <a
        href="https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/building-a-better-node-community-3f8f45b45cb5">the
        creation of the NodeSchool community</a> in Mikael Roger’s excellent post on the
        topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, on May 23rd the NodeSchool community is <a href="http://nodeschool.io/international-day/">organizing</a>
        a day of educational web events around the globe.
        This coincides with the second day of CampJS, so to celebrate we’ll be
        mentoring NodeSchool sessions for <strong>the six workshops which were originally
        created for a CampJS event</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.github.com/rvagg/learnyounode">LearnYouNode</a> by Rod Vagg</li>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/domenic/count-to-6">Count to 6</a> by Dominic Denicola</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/sporto/planetproto">Planet Proto</a> by Sebastian Porto</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        This is in addition to launching new TBA workshops.
      </p>
      <h3><blockquote>"Try and leave this world a little better than you found it"</blockquote></h3>
      <p>
        CampJS follows the <a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule">scouts rule</a>.
        With this in mind, we strongly encourage &amp; support the creation of
        NodeSchool-esque workshops so presenter’s efforts can benefit the
        global JavaScript community, continuing to educate far beyond the scope
        of a CampJS event. It would be great if this were a model more
        conferences would adopt! Big props to NodeConf US which also inspired
        the creation of a number of NodeSchool workshops last year.
